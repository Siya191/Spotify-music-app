# Spotify

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world.

Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium.

Whether you have Premium or not, you can:

* Get recommendations based on your taste
* Build collections of music and podcasts
* And more!


## Here I just created a small portion of it with some functionality.
